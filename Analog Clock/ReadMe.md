Hello My name is Kikani Pushkar.
I am currently pursuing my Diploma in Computer Engineering at VPMP Polytechnic.
This is basic Analog Clock made by me using JS.

<h2>Analog Clock Project</h2>
This project creates an analog clock that dynamically updates every second. The clock includes the hour, minute, and second hands with distinct colors, and features a glowing animation effect when hovered over.

<h2>Features</h2>
<b>Real-Time Clock:</b> <br>
The clock updates every second to show the current time.<br></br>

<b>Dynamic Hands:</b> <br>
The hour, minute, and second hands are animated to move smoothly as the time passes.<br>

<b>Custom Styling:</b> <br>
The clock's design is made using CSS for a sleek, modern look with smooth transitions and glow effects.<br>

<b>Mobile Responsive:</b> <br>
The clock adjusts well on all screen sizes. <br>

<h2>Technologies Used </h2>
HTML for structure, <br> <br>
CSS for styling and animations, <br> <br>
JavaScript for real-time clock functionality. <br>

<h2>File Descriptions </h2>
<b>Analog.html:</b> <br>
This is the structure of the clock. It includes:

A div element for the clock container.
Three child div elements representing the hour, minute, and second hands.
A set of span elements for the numbers on the clock face.<br><br>
<b>Analog.css: </b><br>
This file contains the styles for the clock:

Background and layout of the clock.
Styles for the clock hands and numbers.
Animation for the glowing effect on hover. <br>

<b>Analog.js: </b> <br>
This file handles the logic for updating the time on the clock:

It retrieves the current time using JavaScript's Date() object.
It calculates the rotation values for each hand of the clock based on the current time.
It updates the rotation of the clock hands every second using setInterval().
