This is Image Editor made by me using JS.

<h2>Image Editor</h2>
This project is an easy-to-use image editor built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to upload an image, apply various filters (such as brightness, saturation, inversion, and grayscale), rotate or flip the image, and then save the modified image.

Apply brightness, saturation, inversion, and grayscale effects to the image using a slider.<br><br>

<b>Rotate & Flip:</b> <br>
Rotate the image by 90 degrees in both directions and flip it horizontally or vertically.<br>

<b>Real-time Preview:</b> <br>
Preview the image changes as they happen.<br>

<b>Image Upload:</b> <br>
Upload an image directly from the user's device.<br>

<b>Save Image:</b> <br>
